
# Cellmatch â€“ Matlab

A computational toolbox for identifying neurons, recorded with *in vivo* calcium imaging using miniaturized epifluorescence microscopes (miniscopes), *post hoc* in histology. Identifying *in vivo* recorded neurons *post hoc* allows a cell-type specific discrimination of neuronal subtypes. *in vivo* recorded calcium imaging data was pre-processed using Inscopix Mosaic software. The best way to start is by looking at the example data provided.

# Documentation
The main script is [Main.m](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/Main.m) that will guide you through the processing operations. [Sampledata.mat](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/Sampledata.mat) stores manually derived parameters for processing the [sample data](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/tree/main/Data) provided.


## Processing *in vivo* recorded calcium imaging data
The script [InVivo_Align_CaImagingSessions.m](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/InVivo_Align_CaImagingSessions.m) loads *in vivo* recorded Ca2+ imaging data. Ca2+ imaging data was pre-processed with [Inscopix](https://www.inscopix.com/) Mosaic software. For further details on required structure of *in vivo* recorded Ca2+ imaging data, please refer to section [*in vivo* Ca2+ imaging data ](#ca2+data). First, the final experiment for the detection of blood vessels (RECDSA) is loaded and processed. All following experiments are loaded and co-registered with RECDSA. [Sampledata.mat](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/Sampledata.mat) data includes all manually defined control points for registration. 

## Processing of histology data
[Volumetric laser confocal microscope scans](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/tree/main/Data/Post%20hoc%20histology) are provided within the sample data. Histology was not labeled with antibodies and endogenous Green fluorescence protein (GFP) signals from the Calciun indicator GCaMP6f were scanned. Histology imaging data is processed within [Main.m](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/Main.m). 

If you performed co-labeling of neurons in histology, you must export z-stacks of all channels separately and load them within [Main.m](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/Main.m). All transformations must then also be applied to the data structures of histology channel 2. When you assess the expression of fluorescent markers of matched cells using [plot_interactive_identifiedcells.m](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/functions/plot_interactive_identifiedcells.m), you can switch the displayed channels of the histology scans. 

## <a id="ca2+data"></a> Structure of *in vivo* Ca2+ imaging data 
In the sample data, three individual *in vivo* Ca2+ imaging recordings are provided:
1. [2411](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/tree/main/Data/In%20vivo%20Ca2%2B/2411)
2. [2811](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/tree/main/Data/In%20vivo%20Ca2%2B/2811)
3. [1412](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/tree/main/Data/In%20vivo%20Ca2%2B/1412)

Each *in vivo* Ca2+ recording consists of:
1. a Minimum intensity projection image of the original movie ([*.minrec.tif](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/Data/In%20vivo%20Ca2%2B/1412/JP68-1412-01-minrec.tif))
2. a [.csv](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/Data/In%20vivo%20Ca2%2B/1412/JP68-1412-01-traces.csv) file containing calcium transients and calcium events
3. and a folder [IC](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/tree/main/Data/In%20vivo%20Ca2%2B/1412/IC) containing all independent component images (IC) of all identified neurons.

Each [.csv](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/Data/In%20vivo%20Ca2%2B/1412/JP68-1412-01-traces.csv) file must follow a specific structure:
1. The first row contains variable names (export them from Mosaic)
2. The first column includes a time code
3. The following columns contain dF/F traces, optionally calcium event traces as well. 

Further, a final [experiment](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/tree/main/Data/In%20vivo%20Ca2%2B/1912-DSA) a fluorescent dye was injected into the tail vein of the anaesthetized animal. Prior to the injection of the fluorescent dye, a three-minute-long recording was obtained. Following the injection of the fluorescent dye, another three-minute-long recording was obtained. In this experiment no neuronal activity was recorded. Instead, projection images of the original movies are provided:
1. [min-natice.tif](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/Data/In%20vivo%20Ca2%2B/1912-DSA/JP68-1912-min_native.tif) is a minimum intensity projection image of the recording acquired prior to the injection of the fluorescent dye.
2. [mean-native.tif](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/Data/In%20vivo%20Ca2%2B/1912-DSA/JP68-1912-mean-native.tif) is a mean intensity projection image of the recording acquired prior to the injection of the fluorescent dye.
3. [maxIP-CE.tif](https://github.com/Phil-An/CellMatch/blob/main/Data/In%20vivo%20Ca2%2B/1912-DSA/JP68-1912-MaxIP_CE.tif) is a standard deviation projection image of the recording acquired following the injection of the fluorescent dye.
